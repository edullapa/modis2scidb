  MODIS to SciDB (modis2scidb)
  ============================


The cmake folder contains a CMake project for building modis2scidb.

Until now its build has been tested on:
- Linux Ubuntu 12.04
- Linux CentOS 6.5
- Mac OS X Mavericks.

Future releases will be tested on Microsoft Windows.

You should use at least CMake version 2.8.7 for building modis2scidb. Older versions than this may not work properly.

Follow the build steps below according to your platform.


1. Build instructions on Linux with g++ (GNU gcc)
-------------------------------------------------

1.1. Open a Command Prompt.

1.2. We will assume that the codebase (all the source tree) is located at:
/home/user/modis2scidb/codebase

1.3. Create a folder out of the modis2scidb source tree, for example:
$ cd /home/user/modis2scidb
$ mkdir build-linux
$ cd build-linux

1.4. For Linux systems you must choose the build configuration:
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING="Release" -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:PATH="/mylibs1;/mylibs2;/mylibs3" ../codebase/build/cmake

Notes:

       a) Some Linux flavours with diffrent versions of GNU gcc and Boost will
          need more parameters:
          $ cmake ../codebase/build/cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
                  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING="Debug"
                  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:PATH="/mylibs1;/mylibs2;/mylibs3"
                  -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH="/mylibs/include"
                  -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH="/mylibs/lib"
                  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-lpthread -std=c++11"

       b) For GNU gcc releases before 4.7 the -std=c++11
          must be replaced by -std=c++0x

       c) The parameter -lpthread must be informed only
          if your Boost was not built as a shared library.

       d) If you are using a CMake version before 2.8.11
          the above command must be run twice in order to
          enable the right components.

       e) Some versions of Clang and gcc needs to add
          -ftemplate-depth-1024 to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS.
