  MODIS to SciDB (modis2scidb)
  ============================

modis2scidb is a command line tool designed to convert remote sensing
imagery data from MODIS - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
aboard NASAâ€™s Aqua and Terra satellites (http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov),
to SciDB, an open source Data Management and Analytics System (DMAS).
It can convert a set of MODIS HDF datasets into a SciDB multidimensional
arrays.

The codebase of modis2scidb is organized as follow:

- build........: this folder contains the build system
                 and instructions for building modis2scidb
                 on several platforms and compilers.
